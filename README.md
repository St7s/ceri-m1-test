+ **Test/Code Coverage** - [![codecov.io Code Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://codecov.io/github/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2?branch=master) - coverage is the measure of how much of the code in a project is tested. Anything ***below 100% coverage*** means the module/library has ***potential bugs*** which are unknown to the authors/users. We avoid using modules with less than 100% coverage and encourage others to *question* why the authors did not put in the time to test their code... ***ALL our code is tested***. *we cannot guarantee every line is "bug-free", (and always welcome people reporting any issues!) however we are meticulous about testing our work and always add regression/edge test cases where bugs are discovered!*
